                  <p> My name is Beenish Munir Butt.
                    <br>Full Stack Web Developer with a background in computer science.
                    Pride myself on clear communication skills, a strong teamwork ethic and the agility to adapt to changes in technology and the environment in which I work. Fully dedicated to my work and studies and keen on learning more. 
                    
                    <p>
                    I did Masters in E-Commerce from BZU Multan in 2005.
                    Then I started my family and planned to lookafter them
                    full time.</p>
                    <p>I live in North Wales with my husband, two mischievous boys, adorable
                      little girl and a cutest cat. 
                    <br>Now all my kids are in school, I decided to pursue
                      my career in Web Development so I searched so many courses
                      and finally joined Coding Boot Camp in The University of Manchester.
                      <br>It's a good opportunity for me to reskill, improve and learn new
                      technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I was doing my Masters in E-Commerce, for my final
                      project I developed a result system of my department
                      which was running on the intranet of the Commerce department.
